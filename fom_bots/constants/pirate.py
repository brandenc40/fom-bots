    "As I was a-walking one morning by chance;\nI heard a maid making her moan,\nI asked why she sighed, and she sadly replied\n'Alas! I must live all alone, alone,\nAlas! I must live all alone.'\n\nI said, 'My fair maid, pray whence have you strayed?\nAnd are you some distance from home?'\n'My home,' replied she, 'is a burden to me,\nFor there I must live all alone, alone,\nFor there I must live all alone.\n\nWhen I was eleven, sweethearts I had seven,\nAnd then I would look upon none;\nBut now all in vain I must sigh and complain,\nFor my true love has left me alone, alone,\nFor my true love has left me alone.\n\nOh! come back from sea, my dear Johnny, to me,\nAnd make me a bride of your own!\nOr else for your sake my poor heart it will break,\nAnd here I shall die all alone, alone,\nAnd here I shall die all alone.",
    'My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light\nAnd he slept with a mermaid one fine night\nOut of this union there came three\nA porpoise and a porgy and the other was me!\nYo ho ho, the wind blows free,\nOh for the life on the rolling sea!\n\nOne night, as I was a-trimming the glim\nSinging a verse from the evening hymn\nI head a voice cry out an "Ahoy!"\nAnd there was my mother, sitting on a buoy.\nYo ho ho, the wind blows free,\nOh for the life on the rolling sea!\n\n"Oh, what has become of my children three?"\nMy mother then inquired of me.\nOne\'s on exhibit as a talking fish\nThe other was served in a chafing dish.\nYo ho ho, the wind blows free,\nOh for the life on the rolling sea!\n\nThen the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair.\nI looked again, and my mother wasn\'t there\nBut her voice came angrily out of the night\n"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"\nYo ho ho, the wind blows free,\nOh for the life on the rolling sea!',
    "One morning, one morning, one morning in May\nI spied a young couple all on the highway\nAnd one was a lady so bright and so fair\nAnd the other was a soldier, a brave volunteer\n\nGood morning, good morning, good morning to thee,\nNow where are you going my pretty lady?\nI'm going to travel to the banks of the sea\nTo see the waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.\n\nThey hadn't been there but an hour or two\nTill out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew\nThe tune that he played caused the vallies to ring.\nO harken, says the lady, how the nightingales sing.\n\nPretty lady, pretty lady, 'tis time to give o're.\nO no, pretty soldier, please play one tune more.\nI'd rather hear your fiddle at the touch of one string\nThan to see the waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.\n\nPretty soldier, pretty soldier, will you marry me?\nO no, pretty lady that never can be.\nI've a wife back in London and children twice three.\nTwo wives in the army is too many for me.",
    "Yonder stands a pretty maiden,\nWho she is I do not know,\nI'll go court her for her beauty,\nLet her answer yes or no.\n\n'Pretty maid, I've come to court you,\nIf your favour I do gain\nAnd you make me hearty welcome,\nI will call this way again.'\n\n'Sit you down, you're heart'ly welcome,\nSit you down and chat a while,\nSit you down, you're heart'ly welcome,\nSuppose you do not call again?'\n\n'Pretty little maid, I've gold and riches,\nPretty little maid, I've houses and lands,\nPretty little maid, I've worldly treasures.\nAnd all will be at your command.'\n\n'What do I care for your worldly treasures?\nWhat do I care for your houses and lands?\nWhat do I care for your gold and riches?\nAll that I want is a nice young man.'\n\n'Why do you dive so deep in beauty?\nIt is a flower will soon decay,\nIt's like the rose that blooms in summer\nWhen winter comes, it fades away.'\n\n'My love wears the tarry trousers,\nMy love wears the jacket blue,\nMy love ploughs the deep blue ocean,\nSo, young man, be off with you.'",
    'Sail! home, as straight as an arrow,\nMy yacht shoots along on the crest of the sea;\nSail! home, to sweet Maggie Darrow,\nIn her dear little home\nShe is waiting for me.\n\nHigh up! where cliffs they are craggy\nThere\'s where, the girl of my heart waits for me\nHeigh! ho, I long for you, Maggie\nI\'ll spread out my "White Wings"\nAnd sail home to thee.\n\nYo! ho, how we go!\nOh! how the winds blow!\n"White Wings" they never grow weary,\nThey carry me cherrily over the sea.\nNight comes, I long for my dearie,\nI\'ll spread out my "White Wings"\nAnd sail home to thee.',
    "Come, all young men of learning good,\nA warning take by me.\nI'll have you quit night walking\nAnd shun bad company;\nI'll have you quit night walking\nOr else you'll rue the day,\nAnd you will be transported\nAnd go to Botany Bay.\n\nI was brought up in London town,\nA place I knew full well;\nBrought up by honest parents,\nThe truth to you I'll tell.\nBrought up by honest parents,\nWho loved me tenderly,\nTill I became a roving blade\nTo prove my destiny.\n\nMy character was taken,\nAnd I was sent to gaol.\nMy parents tried to clear me\nBut nothing would prevail.\n'Twas at our Rutland sessions\nThe Judge to me did say:\nThe Jury's found you guilty,\nYou must go to Botany Bay.\n\nTo see my poor old father\nAs he stood at the bar;\nLikewise my dear old mother\nHer old gray locks she tore.\nAnd in tearing of her old gray locks\nThese words to me she did say:\nO son! O son! What hast thou done?\nThou art bound for Botany Bay."
